## Figure with widgets

You can also annotate figure with multiple widgets that can improve the visualisation experience. It might be desirable to give readers/consumers the possibility to adjust the figure to their preferences. The example below shows how the colormap of the figure can be adjusted to bee more colorblind friendly and the reader can change the colormap too.
