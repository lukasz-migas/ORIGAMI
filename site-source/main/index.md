### About 
ORIGAMI-ANALYSE is a data processing and visualisation software

The analysis software, ORIGAMI-ANALYSE can aid analysis of MS and IM-MS results from multiple instrumental platforms, offering rich data extraction, data processing and visualisation environment. Data can be imported from text (.csv/.txt/.tab), tandem MS (.mgf/.mzML/.mzIdent) and raw files (Waters .raw). ORIGAMI-ANALYSE was developed to handle a large number of files simultaneously, providing comparative and interactive environment to visualise results from multiple resources, generate publication-quality figures and interpret the results in more depth. All the processed data can be also exported as an interactive .html document that can be visualised in a web-browser and shared with your colleagues, reviewers or editors, as well as included as an SI.
