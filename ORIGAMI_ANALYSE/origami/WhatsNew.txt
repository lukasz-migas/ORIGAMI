# TODO:

- add new document viewer which allows reviewing what data is included
    in selected dataset i.e. size, shape, labels, processign steps etc

- document panel
    = add support for groups which will clean-up the gui a little 
    as it is ver hard to search for anything in the document tree
    = when renaming MS, it should check whether the file has UniDec results, if 
    it does, rename it too

- UniDec support
    = add new 2D plot which colours charge states of various components as with RGB plot
    = add adduct in the Pre-processing or deconvolution part
    = add isotopic resolution in deconvolution
    
- Peak list
    = when double-clicking on an item it incorrectly selects method (Linear/Manual)
    = add option to visualise global ATD as a waterfall
    
- Support loading other data formats
    = when loading 2D dataset, check column names to see if they are float, if not
        add them as separate 1D items
    = custom tooltips?
        This could be quite simple. A user would have an option to select type of annotation
        which could be integer, float or string and for which item(s) in the plot. These would be 
        then rendered as tooltip features
    = add several new options:
        -- add MS from clipboard/file(s)
        -- add 2D from clipboard/file(s)

- interactive output
	= add support for waterfall plots (2D datasets)
	= only allow numbers in last column
	
- add new sub-document item: Saved images
	= should allow saving already generated images to the document (no re-plotting required!)
	
- complete revamp of Linear DT files panel
	= add features like highlighting on RT and MS panels
	= load lists
	= fix feature detection
	
- complete revamp of CCS panel
	
- contact Eric to see if I could implement impact in ORIGAMI

- add other biophysical tools

- add support for Agilent files

- retention time:
    = combine multiple areas

# v1.2.0.4 / v1.2.1
# TODO: change testkDa from 10,000 to user-defined value. Also change the num of d.p 
        in the statusbar updater

Documentation:
- Added online documentation (also copied locally in ORIGAMI path/docs/index.html). 
    See online at https://lukasz-migas.github.io/ORIGAMI/
- Added 10 new video guides to the Youtube playlist (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrPB7zfH4WXMYa5CN9qDtl-G-Ax_L6AK8)


Document tree:
- [fix] Fixed type: spectrun -> spectrum (grr)
- [fix] When loading mzml/mgf files, the individual scans will no longer 
    be shown in the document tree as it caused some major issues. If you would like
    to see the individual spectra, please double-click on the header 'Tandem Mass Spectra'
    and new window will appear when you can select scan by double-clicking on it
    in the table
- [improvement] When loading any data into the INTERACTIVE document, you will be asked 
    whether data should be duplicated, merged or duplicated
- [improvement] When plotting a waterfall plot, data will be checked to ensure its not too big (e.g. too many rows). 
    You will be asked if you would like to continue
  
Annotations:
- [fix] font size, weight and rotation will now be aplied when adding labels
- [fix] annotation parameters (e.g. size, weight, rotation) will be respected when replotting from the Document Tree
- [improvement] auto-label generator will now also create labels based purely on the charge state
- [new] annotations can now be 'picked' and dragged. Those that have been added using the annotation panel
    will also be updated when they have been dragged. The arrows draw in the application will also be adjusted.
- [new] you can now also easily 'duplicate/multiply' annotations. Action -> Multiply annotations...
    this will result in a copy of the selected annotation(s) with slight difference in the min-value (so they can be
    distinguished from its parent

Interactive panel:
= [new] Made big progres in terms of copying/applying styles for plot elements. 
    When you double-click on any element in the file list a new window will appear
    where you can individually adjust plot parameters. When you finished, you can
    right-click on that same (or any other) item in the list and select 'Copy style..'. 
    You can then select any other item in the list, right-click on it and select
    'Apply style..'. 
= [fix] fixed sorting in the list (especilaly when using the 'Show selected' option)
  Lists are sorted using 'natural sorting' from now on, meaning they should be more
  logically sorted.
= [fix] fixed the show/hide table elements when you right-click on the table headers
= [improvement] Colorbars:
    = added loads of new settings users can control
    = better behaviour when adding colorbars to plots
= [change] removed tools/toolset from ORIGAMI - the new system of copy/apply style should work much better

UVPD panel
= added a new plugin that allows analysis and processing of UVPD datasets that were acquire with the laser
    constantly switching between on and off. To activate, click on Menu -> Plugins -> UVPD processing...
    
Tandem MS panel:
- [improvement] improved the way scans are loaded
- [improvement] butterfly plots will now have horizontal line at 0
- [new] you can now load mzML files
- [new] you can now export *annotated* MS/MS datasets in an interactive format
    This is still in development, however if you load mzML or mgf file and annotate
    it using mzIdentML file and subsequently generate fragment annotations 
    (no post-translational modifications...) then you can export it. Files that have 
    not been annotated can also be exported. 
- [improvement] loading of mzML, mgf and mzIdentML files will now be performed in 
  threaded mode (e.g. no more hanging of the application).

# KNOWN ISSUES in 1.2.0.3
- when changing width of the colorbar (or position), the internals disappear
- when adding text 2D files from a overlay document, and then trying to plot 1D or RT data
  there is an error
- resizing RMSF plot gives BIG ERRORS. The top part does not rescale properly.. 
- zooming in RMSF plot is disabled
- rotation does not work in 3D plot
- changing RMSF (top) parameters does not respond
- logging breaks things! Most likely issue with multi-threading etc
Interactive panel:
- disabling/enabling columns shows wrongly says which ones are shown and which ones are not

###########################################
# KNOWN ISSUES in 1.2.0
- when plotting RMSD matrix and then plotting 2D, the plot needs to be completely refreshed as it currently
  only paints on top whats already there (resulting in weird artefacts!)
  
- When plotting heatmap and then plotting processed heatmap, the colorbar 
  doesn't always refresh values
  
- Delting 'multiple mass spectra' from document in the document tree should also 
  trigger removal of that item from the panel
  
- Deleting of item in 'drift time (2D)' in the document tree should also trigger
  removal of that item in the panel

    = waterfall plots
- you can now load MS spectra from clipboard (creates new document
- you can easily compare spectra in the Multiple files panel
- you can load MS text files (.txt/.tab/.csv)
- added UniDec's deconvolution engine
    = you can easily load MS and deconvolute using the well-established UniDec's Bayesian deconvolution algorithm
    = ORIGAMI generates similar plots to those of UniDec
    = all deconvolution results can be exported in HTML format
    = if you happen to use this feature, please don't forget to cite UniDec!

    you can disable threading from Properties --> General parameters --> Threading
- you can now use DELETE key to remove items from within Tree Control
- you can now *TRY* to automatically assign charge states to high-res data. This function is only experimental and should be always checked!
