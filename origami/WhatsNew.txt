# TODO:

- move to py3
- move to wxPython 4+

- add new document viewer which allows reviewing what data is included
    in selected dataset i.e. size, shape, labels, processign steps etc

- UniDec support
    = add new 2D plot which colours charge states of various components as with RGB plot
    = add adduct in the Pre-processing or deconvolution part
    = add isotopic resolution in deconvolution
    
- Peak list
    = when double-clicking on an item it incorrectly selects method (Linear/Manual)
    = add option to visualise global ATD as a waterfall
    
- Support loading other data formats
    = when loading 2D dataset, check column names to see if they are float, if not
        add them as separate 1D items
    = custom tooltips?
        This could be quite simple. A user would have an option to select type of annotation
        which could be integer, float or string and for which item(s) in the plot. These would be 
        then rendered as tooltip features
        -- add 2D from clipboard/file(s)

- add new sub-document item: Saved images
	= should allow saving already generated images to the document (no re-plotting required!)
	
- complete revamp of Linear DT files panel
    = remove the DT panel and add it as a plugin instead
	= add features like highlighting on RT and MS panels
	= load lists
	= fix feature detection
	
- complete revamp of CCS panel
    = remove the CCS panel and add it as a plugin instead
	
- add support for Agilent files

- retention time:
    = combine multiple areas
    
- move the MS extraction to Waters official API and stop using Driftscope for this

Interactive:
    - add pie chart

# v1.3.0.0
Code:
- migrated ORIGAMI to Python3
- migrated ORIGAMI GUI to wxPython 4
- cleaned up a lot of poorly designed code
- removed a lot of old, not used code

GUI:
- [changed] renamed the Menu item "Plugins" with "Widgets"

Document:
- [new] added new keyword "metadata" which will store parameters for verious processes

Plotting:
- [new] DT/MS - added smart-zoom option which will speed-up data viewing for very large arrays
    to activate, right-click and select "Customise smart-zoom" where you can adjust settings

Document tree:
- [improved] when deleting items from the "Drift time (2D, EIC)" sub-tree, patches corresponding to the ion will be 
    automatically removed from the MS plot
- [improved] when adding new data to the document, the document tree should stop flickering and constantly resetting
    the view and rather expand the current nodes

Processing:
- [changed] moved ORIGAMI-MS settings away from the processing window. Now, in order to setup FILE specific settings,
    you must right-click on the document in the Document tree and select "Action -> Setup ORIGAMI-MS settings..." which
    will open a new window with the settings. Settings for each file are now stored within the file metadata, so it is less
    likely to get things mixed up. 
    - as a consequence, the ORIGAMI-MS panel in Processing was removed
    - as a consequence, the ORIGAMI-MS settings section in Ion settings was removed
// TODO: It also features a small plot area which will show you the settings profile that was used
- [changed] removed the settings "DT/MS binning parameters" in Process -> Mass spectrum as it was not intuitive. From
    now on in order to change DT/MS settings, you must navigate to the Document Tree view, right-click on the DT/MS
    item in the Document and select Open DT/MS extraction panel... where you can adjust the m/z range and bin size. You
    can also select whether data should be extracted (to visualise), saved to file or added to the document. This menu 
    can also be accessed by going to Document -> Action -> Open DT/MS extraction panel...

Ion panel:
- [fix] when assigning single color to multiple items and the action was cancelled, an error would occur
- [improved] renamed a couple of menu items to make them clearer
- [improved] when double-clicking on an item, a smaller editor will be opened which will exclude all ORIGAMI-MS settings
- [improved] item editor now has correct order of items which can be explored with Tab and Shift+Tab keys
- [changed] moved the option "Create blank COMPARISON ..." from the Add... menu to "Overlay..." menu

Text panel:
- [improved] item editor now has correct order of items which can be explored with Tab and Shift+Tab keys

Annotations panel:
- [changed] changed the label "Multiple annotations" to "Multiply annotations (selected)" (found in Action...)

Data extraction:
- [improved] Extraction of MS data moved away from Driftscope to Waters SDK which allows extraction of profile data
    that is properly scaled (e.g. not normalized). Waters SDK does not provide `full` m/z/intensity map (only values that
    are not 0s) so data is needs to be interpolated to a common m/z axis. Data is interpolated using `linear` 
    method with the smallest possible bin size (determined by looking at the first 500 scans). 
// TODO: should add some sort of control panel where number of scans can be setup
- [improved] from now on, chromatographic and mobility (1D) data is extracted using Waters SDK
- [fixed] fixed an issue which occured when trying to extract MS data from chromatographic window that only occured if 
    the x-axis was Collision Voltage (V) - from now on you will not see an error and won' be able to extract data


################################################################################
# v1.2.0.4 / v1.2.1
# TODO: change testkDa from 10,000 to user-defined value. Also change the num of d.p 
        in the statusbar updater

Documentation:
- Added online documentation (also copied locally in ORIGAMI path/docs/index.html). 
    See online at https://lukasz-migas.github.io/ORIGAMI/
- Added 10 new video guides to the Youtube playlist (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrPB7zfH4WXMYa5CN9qDtl-G-Ax_L6AK8)

Document tree:
- [fix] Fixed type: spectrun -> spectrum (grr)
- [fix] When loading mzml/mgf files, the individual scans will no longer 
    be shown in the document tree as it caused some major issues. If you would like
    to see the individual spectra, please double-click on the header 'Tandem Mass Spectra'
    and new window will appear when you can select scan by double-clicking on it
    in the table
- [improvement] When loading any data into the INTERACTIVE document, you will be asked 
    whether data should be duplicated, merged or duplicated
- [improvement] When plotting a waterfall plot, data will be checked to ensure its not too big (e.g. too many rows). 
    You will be asked if you would like to continue
    
Main window:
- [new] Added new sub-menu: Plugins. This will hold all future mini-applications that will be added
- [new] Under the menu: Plot there are a couple of new settings windows that can be used
    to optimise visualisation parameters.
- [improvement] The help pages (Help -> Help pages -> ...) have now been replaced with
    links to the provided documentation (opens in the browser). Where no documentation exists yet,
    old pages will be shown.
  
Annotations:
- [fix] font size, weight and rotation will now be aplied when adding labels
- [fix] annotation parameters (e.g. size, weight, rotation) will be respected when replotting from the Document Tree
- [improvement] auto-label generator will now also create labels based purely on the charge state
- [new] annotations can now be 'picked' and dragged. Those that have been added using the annotation panel
    will also be updated when they have been dragged. The arrows draw in the application will also be adjusted.
- [new] you can now also easily 'duplicate/multiply' annotations. Action -> Multiply annotations...
    this will result in a copy of the selected annotation(s) with slight difference in the min-value (so they can be
    distinguished from its parent

Interactive panel:
= [new] Made big progres in terms of copying/applying styles for plot elements. 
    When you double-click on any element in the file list a new window will appear
    where you can individually adjust plot parameters. When you finished, you can
    right-click on that same (or any other) item in the list and select 'Copy style..'. 
    You can then select any other item in the list, right-click on it and select
    'Apply style..'. 
= [fix] fixed sorting in the list (especilaly when using the 'Show selected' option)
  Lists are sorted using 'natural sorting' from now on, meaning they should be more
  logically sorted.
= [fix] fixed the show/hide table elements when you right-click on the table headers
= [improvement] Colorbars:
    = added loads of new settings users can control
    = better behaviour when adding colorbars to plots
= [change] removed tools/toolset from ORIGAMI - the new system of copy/apply style should work much better
= [new] certain plot types (v-bar, h-bar, scatter, waterfall, multi-line/overlay) 
    will now support addition of annotations (and their widgets). Annotations can correspond 
    to anything you wish to say about specific region of a dataset. 
= [improvement] I've realised that using 'coffeescript' for widget exportation was
    a big mistake as it takes ~10x+ longer to compile that script than pure JavaScript.
    Adding widgets will be a lot faster from now on (a couple haven't been ported
    to JS yet).

UVPD panel
= added a new plugin that allows analysis and processing of UVPD datasets that were acquire with the laser
    constantly switching between on and off. To activate, click on Menu -> Plugins -> UVPD processing...
    
Tandem MS panel:
- [improvement] improved the way scans are loaded
- [improvement] butterfly plots will now have horizontal line at 0
- [new] you can now load mzML files
- [new] you can now export *annotated* MS/MS datasets in an interactive format
    This is still in development, however if you load mzML or mgf file and annotate
    it using mzIdentML file and subsequently generate fragment annotations 
    (no post-translational modifications...) then you can export it. Files that have 
    not been annotated can also be exported. 
- [improvement] loading of mzML, mgf and mzIdentML files will now be performed in 
  threaded mode (e.g. no more hanging of the application).
  
UVPD panel:
- [new] you can now extract mass spectra from the found regions that correspond to
    dataset 1 and dataset 2. Unfortunately spectra always return of different size
    (thanks Waters) so they need to be linearized. You can change those settings in
    Menu -> Process -> Mass Spectra.
    
Other data:
- [change] changed the poorly named 'Other data' to 'Annotated data'
- [new] added new keyword 'axis_url/axis_urls' which can be used to provide web address
    which will be used on action. Currently only implemented in scatter plots where
    tap on any data point will take you to a new web address

# KNOWN ISSUES in 1.2.0.3
- when changing width of the colorbar (or position), the internals disappear
- when adding text 2D files from a overlay document, and then trying to plot 1D or RT data
  there is an error
- resizing RMSF plot gives BIG ERRORS. The top part does not rescale properly.. 
- zooming in RMSF plot is disabled
- rotation does not work in 3D plot
- changing RMSF (top) parameters does not respond
- logging breaks things! Most likely issue with multi-threading etc
Interactive panel:
- disabling/enabling columns shows wrongly says which ones are shown and which ones are not

###########################################
# KNOWN ISSUES in 1.2.0
- when plotting RMSD matrix and then plotting 2D, the plot needs to be completely refreshed as it currently
  only paints on top whats already there (resulting in weird artefacts!)
  
- When plotting heatmap and then plotting processed heatmap, the colorbar 
  doesn't always refresh values
  
- Delting 'multiple mass spectra' from document in the document tree should also 
  trigger removal of that item from the panel
  
- Deleting of item in 'drift time (2D)' in the document tree should also trigger
  removal of that item in the panel

    = waterfall plots
- you can now load MS spectra from clipboard (creates new document
- you can easily compare spectra in the Multiple files panel
- you can load MS text files (.txt/.tab/.csv)
- added UniDec's deconvolution engine
    = you can easily load MS and deconvolute using the well-established UniDec's Bayesian deconvolution algorithm
    = ORIGAMI generates similar plots to those of UniDec
    = all deconvolution results can be exported in HTML format
    = if you happen to use this feature, please don't forget to cite UniDec!

      you can reverse the plot by going to Settings --> Waterfall --> Inverse
- MS comparison panel now supports comparison of spectra from different documents and of different sizes
- added color palettes for certain plots (and when adding new peaks to the peak list)

###########################################
# Tracker of whats new in version 1.0.4/1.1
New:
- you can now extract MS for specified region or RT plot
    KNOWN ISSUE: since the MS is not normalized, when you selection option to zoom-in on a plot, it will cause issues
- you can now zoom in the plot area using the mouse wheel: 
    +/- wheel zooms in the X-axis
    +/- and SHIFT key zoom in the Y axis
- if you hold SHIFT and double-click in plot area, only the Y-axis will be reset
- if you hold CTRL and double-click in plot area, only the X-axis will be reset
- you can now plot MS vs DT plot. The bin size is by default 1 Da. Can be changed differnt values using the Extract Parameters --> MS/DT bin size
- you can now extract RT data for specified MS and DT range
- you can now assign charge states and alpha/transparency in batch mode (from the Peak list panel)
- (experimental) added multi-threading to several functions (Opening ORIGAMI files, saving figures). These are in testing mode, but can speed up operation (or give you an error!)!
    you can disable threading from Properties --> General parameters --> Threading
- you can now use DELETE key to remove items from within Tree Control
- you can now *TRY* to automatically assign charge states to high-res data. This function is only experimental and should be always checked!

Fixes:
- slight improvements to 2D plots (the labels should sit where they are supposed to now!)
- you could not save individual MS from Mass Spectra sub-tree
- zooming got a bit better = should stop hanging!
- fixed an issue which occured during processing of 2D data that resulted in an error
- fixed an issue where adjusting the colormap intensities did nothing
- slight tweaks to the extraction tools
- rearranged a couple of text boxes to make things clearer
- you can assign charge state from multiple places now (Document tree, peak list, Document Information panel)

    - should be able to set start/end point of labels
    - change font 
- add proper threading for loading data + saving images
    - currently when executing, the event ID is not carried through
- better peak picking:
    - should accept currently selected MS as the source of picking

- Alt+Z will now show charge assignment window for a selected item




# Tracker of whats new in version 1.0.2

Fixes:
- fixed an issue which occured during zooming in 1D/2D plots
    The issue occured when you tried to perform horizontal zoom. Occasionally
    it would not happpen. Accidentally introduced it in 1.0.1...
- fixed an issue where incorrect plots were saved when using the 'Document Panel'
