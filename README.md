**ORIGAMI** is a two component software suite for faster acquisition of actived ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) datasets and analysis of MS and IM-MS data.<p>

The acquisition software (**ORIGAMI<sup>MS</sup>**) works by interfacing MassLynx and Waters Research Enabled Software (**WREnS**) to carry out a typically tedious task of increasing the collision or cone voltage prior to ion mobility separation. The program works by executing a set of commands that modify various DC potentials in Waters Synapt G2 (and above) family of instruments. There are four acquisition modes available (linear, exponential, Boltzmann and User-defined) which determine the activation ramp parameters.

## ORIGAMI<sup>MS</sup> requirements

- Installed WREnS on your instrument PC (please contact Waters Corp. for access to WREnS and installation instructions)
- Download [ORIGAMI<sup>MS</sup>](https://github.com/lukasz-migas/ORIGAMI/releases/tag/v1.0.1) and associated WREnS scripts
- Read the [User Guide](https://github.com/lukasz-migas/ORIGAMI/blob/master/ORIGAMI_MS/UserGuide_MS.pdf) for more details or watch the YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/XNfM6F_MSb0)
- Installation instructions can be found in the [User Guide](https://github.com/lukasz-migas/ORIGAMI/blob/master/ORIGAMI_MS/UserGuide_MS.pdf)

**Note:** ORIGAMI-MS was moved to its own repository to tidy things up. You cna find [here](https://github.com/lukasz-migas/ORIGAMI-MS)

The analysis software (**ORIGAMI<sup>ANALYSE</sup>**) can import single or multiple IM-MS Waters files (.raw) or a list of text files (.csv, .txt) to visualise and interrogate the ion mobility data. It provides an analysis platform to extract, process, visualise and export MS and IM-MS data to convenient image or text formats. The program was designed to handle activated IM-MS datasets, hence can easily manipulate large number of files to generate CIU or SID fingerprint maps; datasets can be compared and overlayed to produce high-quality images. All of the processed data can be also exported in an interactive format, to give a webpage-like behaviour with utility tools such as zooming, panning, data hovering and much more.

Some **ORIGAMI<sup>ANALYSE</sup>** features:

- import single or multiple Waters raw files (requires Driftscope)
- import single or multiple text files
- batch data extraction from raw files
- comparison and overlay of CIU/SID/UVPD datasets
- export all data as static image or in an interactive webpage format
- create and apply CCS calibration to proteins and small molecules
- tools to analyse linear DTIMS datasets

## ORIGAMI<sup>ANALYSE</sup> requirements

- Driftscope (should be provided with your Waters instrument) - if Driftscope is not present, you will not be able to extract MS or IM-MS data
- Read the [User Guide](https://github.com/lukasz-migas/ORIGAMI/blob/master/ORIGAMI_ANALYSE/UserGuide.pdf)
- Installation instructions can be found in the [User Guide](https://github.com/lukasz-migas/ORIGAMI/blob/master/ORIGAMI_ANALYSE/UserGuide.pdf)
