<h2><strong>What changed in ORIGAMI<sup>ANALYSE&nbsp;</sup>:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a major update (hence version upgrade to 1.1.0) so none of the previous pickle files&nbsp;<strong>will not</strong> work. I intend to move to hdf5 in future to ensure this sort of problem&nbsp;doesn't persist, but for the time being please hang on. This version incorporates major changes to the user interface with many improvements added to ensure better plotting capabilities and more consistent behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fixes in v1.1.0:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many fixes that should improve the general usability and reliability of the analysis software</li>
<li>Minor problems when analysing multiple MassLynx files simultaneously</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improvements in v1.1.0:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the entire layout of the user interface. It is a lot cleaner looking (in my opinion, of course..) and should hopefully make for a better analysis experience. The whole design is based on having multiple little windows open that allow simultaneous&nbsp;tweaking of the plot parameters, data processing and data extraction</li>
<li>Many of the plotting functions have been improved and you might notice some speed-ups!</li>
<li>Changed the way you modify ion or text file parameters. You can simply double-click on any item in the Peaklist or Text file list&nbsp;panels for quick editing options</li>
<li>Added lots of shortcuts to speed analysis</li>
<li>Significantly improved the way charge states are detected for high-resolution mass spectra</li>
<li>Legends are now draggable (not pickable, yet..)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New in v1.1.0:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added new 'RGB' format in the overlay methods. It simply allows you to plot more than two species simultaneously.</li>
<li>Added quickly accessible links to request new features + report any bugs.</li>
<li>You can now easily save and interact with the logging window - very useful if you would like to send me any bug reports!</li>
<li>Added lots of little convenience&nbsp;tools in the Overlay panels.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You can now export <strong>NEARLY</strong> all plot types in an interactive format. The two exceptions are 3D plots and RGB plots. These are coming... (slowly!)</li>
<li>Added compare MS module where you can select mass spectra from different collision voltages and directly compare how they relate to one another</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The DT-IMS panel still lacks a lot of functions</li>
<li>The CCS panel is quite clunky and not intuitive - needs a revamp!</li>
<li>When zooming-in and the mouse cursor goes outside of the plot axes, the zoom tools get locked-up - kind of annoying</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ORIGAMI-MS:</strong></p>
<p>There have been no changes to ORIGAMI<sup>MS</sup>, so please download it from release 1.0.1.</p>
<p><strong>Video tutorials:</strong></p>
<p>A couple of videos is available on YouTube. Will try to add more in future.</p>

<p><strong>How to update</strong></p>
<p>Since the whole package was revamped, the only way to update ORIGAMI is to download the ORIGAMI_ANALYSE_v1.1.0.zip file, unpack it somewhere on your PC and it should work out of the box. :)</p>
<p>As you might notice, the size of the directory increased quite a bit, it is about 500 Mb when unpacked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Lukasz</p>
